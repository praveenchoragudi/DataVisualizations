# DataVisualizations
 This repository displays data visualisations that assist in telling stories by organising the data into an understandable format and emphasising patterns and outliers. A strong visualisation highlights important information while reducing data noise.
 
 ## Developing our research question 
 We have done some exploratory data analysis in our [project](https://github.com/praveenchoragudi/Data_Exploration_SQL). Now, we will be visualizing the results obtained from our data exploration with COVID 19 data. In this process we will use Tableau to visualize in bar charts, tables, maps, line charts depending on the data results we achieved earlier in the project.
 
 ## Getting our data
 There is a sql file created from the data exploration exclusively including the queries that we want to visualize. The tables generated on executing this .sql file are saved in the tables folder.
